# Copilot Kensington

This is an implementation of the [Kensington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_(game)) game as implemented and deployed by Copilot.

All code was written by copilot. I created this repo and let Copilot do all the commits and pushes to the `gh-pages` [branch](https://github.com/nickh/kensington/tree/gh-pages), where the game is playable [here](https://nickh.github.io/kensington/).
